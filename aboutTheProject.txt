This project is a final project created to finish the Introduction to Programming course available at CDV (Collegium Da Vinci).

This Tic-Tac-Toe implementation in this project is a game against the computer. But this computer makes a move using by Minimax Algorithm. The minimax algorithm analyzes all the moves of the opposing player and the computer makes the appropriate move according to these analyzes. The computer uses the minimax algorithm when making moves. That's why no one playing this game can beat the computer.
